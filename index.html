  <p>The Rapid Panel is a prefabricated assembly of high-strength steel wire forming a panel with a core of expanded polystyrene (EPS). During construction, Rapid Panels are installed as walls and/or slabs. Specified mixtures of mortar or concrete are applied to the surfaces of the panels to complete the structure. The basic unit of the Rapid Panel is the zig-zag truss.</p>

  <h3>Quickbuild 3D Panels</h3>
  <p>QuickBuild Panel system consists of a welded wire space frame integrated with a polystyrene insulation core. The wall panel is placed in position and a wythe of concrete is applied to both sides. The wall panel receives its strength and rigidity from the diagonal cross wires welded to the welded-wire fabric on each side. This combination produces a truss behavior, which provides rigidity and shear terms for a full composite behavior.</p>
